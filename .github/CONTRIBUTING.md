## âœ¨ Contributing Content

This project shares interview prep code challenges and resources for the YearOne community, prompting daily prep topics and grouping resources by difficulty level.

**To contribute**, you'll find all of the contributed resources in the `topics.yaml` file of the repository. Topics entered into this file are checked on a cron schedule using Github Actions.

- Daily topics are randomly chosen, for all topics that have a difficulty level of `Beginner` or `Medium`, and posted straight to the YearOne community platform in the #Daily Challenge page.
- A scheduled cron will run every few hours to scan for new entries and post them to the corresponding difficulty page in the YearOne community.

### What makes a good topic?

A good topic can be a coding question or challenge from a popular site, a technical article or tutorial that teaches a skill, or a link to a video that you found handy for interview prep.

Please check that all links provided are accessible for **free**. To do this, take the link and run it in an incognito window, if it's viewable, then it's accessible to all.

### Formatting a Topic

Follow the formatting of the existing yaml file and the details below. Find out more about yaml files and their structure [here](https://yaml.org/).

```yaml
'1': #Represents the topic number, these should be sequential with the newest topic on the top of the file
  title: 'Common Prefix Problem' #The title of the topic or post
  difficulty: 'Beginner' #The difficulty should be Beginner, Medium or Advanced only, to make for easier parsing
  source: 'Leetcode' #The name of where the question/article or resource came from
  # Make sure to leave the pipe after the body key, to have Yaml recognize the next indented block as multi-line.
  # The Body text is written with HTML tags, for proper rendering to the community. Make sure to use break <br> tags to
  # indicate new lines, and <a> tags to insert links!
  body: |
    <strong>Beginner-level algorithm focused on strings!</strong><br>
    Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. <br>
    If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".<br>
    <br>
    <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/" target="_blank">ðŸŽ„Tree Algo Link!</a>
  author_name: 'Kristal' # (Optional) We shout out the contributor when the topic is posted, include your name if you'd like
  author_email: 'kristal@joinyearone.io' # (Optional) When we post in circle, we can change the author of the post by supplying
  # a members email address

```

## Tackling an Issue

As an open-source project, we'll have open [issues](https://github.com/YearOne-Prep/YearOne-prep-challenges/issues) that list out our enhancement and bug-fixes that need support. If you see one that you'd be willing to help with, here are the steps you should take:

- Step 1:
  - Find the ticket that you'd like to handle.
- Step 2:
  - Make sure the ticket has all the information you need to get started. Post comments if you need more clarity or direction.
- Step 3:
  - When you're ready to take on the ticket, comment that you're working on it. The ticket will then get assigned to you by a maintainer.
- Step 4:
  - When your code or solution is ready, open your pull request for review.
  - (optional) Link the Issue to your Pull Request in the right side-bar of the issue itself.
- Step 5:
  - Merge that PR when it's approved and we'll close out the issue!
